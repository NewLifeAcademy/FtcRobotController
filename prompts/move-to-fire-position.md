We have tested out robot at several points on the field, and captured the data in lines 116-143 in SpainBotMoveToFireSpotWithCamera. In SpainBotAutoWaypointTest we have written code that creates a SequentialAction that will move the robot to a specific position and heading on the field. In SpainBotAutoWaypointTest at lines 96-102 we already have code that will look for an AprilTag when the y button is pressed. Please add code that will then also move our robot, using a SequentialAction to our "Target" position if an AprilTag is detected.
